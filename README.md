## Features

- Increment counter with a button
- Reset counter with a button
- Vibration feedback on reset

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up your development environment and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or later)
- Expo CLI (optional but recommended)
- A code editor like VSCode
- A mobile device or emulator for testing

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cwtausif/counter-app.git
   cd counter-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you are in the project directory and then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or if you are using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the Project**

   To start the development server, run:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

   or if you have Expo CLI installed globally:

   ```bash
   expo start
   ```

   This will open a new browser window with the Expo DevTools. You can use a mobile device or emulator to scan the QR code and view the app.

### Usage

- **Increment Counter**: Press the "Increment" button to increase the counter value.
- **Reset Counter**: Press the "Reset" button to reset the counter to zero. This action triggers a vibration for feedback.

### Code Overview

- **App.js**: The main file containing the app's logic and UI components.
- **styles**: Defined in `App.js` for styling the components.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, try the following:

1. **Check Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
2. **Restart Development Server**: Sometimes restarting the server helps.
3. **Check for Errors**: Review the terminal output for any errors or warnings.
